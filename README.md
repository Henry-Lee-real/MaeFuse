## **Core Concept**: 

The mainstream approach often uses downstream tasks to drive fusion, resulting in more explicit object information in the fusion results. However, this leads to increased complexity and overfitting issues. Our core idea is that such complex downstream tasks are unnecessary. Instead, using a pre-trained encoder with high-level semantic information, such as MAE, can solve all problems effectively. The Fig.1 below explains this well. While we use MAE as the pre-trained encoder, you could also use other encoders with better performance, such as VAE.

## How to use

**Setup**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. Use the following command to initialize the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The dataset directory specified in `--address` must contain two subdirectories named `vi` and `ir` that contain visible and infrared images respectively.

To use this script, you need to provide the following command-line arguments:

1. `--checkpoint`: Path to the model checkpoint file (e.g., `final_new_60.pth`).
2. `--address`: Path to the dataset directory (e.g., `TNO_dataset`).
3. `--output`: Path to the folder where output images will be saved.

### Train Command
**Note**: For details on training code usage, refer to the internal documentation in `train.py`.
```bash
python train.py
```

### Test Command

```bash
python test_fusion.py --checkpoint path_to_weight --address path_to_dataset --output path_to_output
```

### Description of Arguments

- `--checkpoint`: This argument specifies the file path to the model checkpoint, which is used to load the pre-trained model for image fusion.
- `--address`: This argument specifies the directory containing the dataset, which should include both visible and infrared images.
- `--output`: This argument specifies the directory where the fused output images will be saved. If the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.
